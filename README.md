# Sentimental Analysis in Stocks
 
I start this project with web scraping data from Finviz website to get title of articles about stocks, with those articles i made sentimental analysis using NLTK Vader Sentiment to average and rank these titles in one dataframe and compare with returns on the stocks.

* Since there aren't too much data to build, predict and evaluate a model, i stopped the project with compairing with the real returns and the ranks made.
